/// @brief Represents the rising water on GCN Peach Beach and Delfino Pier battle stage.
/// @details In the base game, there are 5 subclasses owned by ObjectPsea. In terms of collision,
/// the water's height is only a function of one of them. We can simplify in Kinoko and remove that
/// subclass entirely since its position can be easily represented without an instance of the class.
/// @note This object is used in an unusual way - the @ref ObjectDirector keeps a pointer to it and
/// uses it to determine the height of the rising water. @ref Kart::KartMove will then use that
/// height to determine whether the kart is submerged and should be slowed down. Because @ref
/// ObjectDirector holds a single pointer to @ref ObjectPsea, if there are multiple instances of
/// this object, then only the most-recently-constructed one will have an effect on the player's
/// speed or out-of-bounds trigger.
